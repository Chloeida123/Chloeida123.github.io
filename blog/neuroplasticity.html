            Neuroplascity is the science behind growth mindset. It's the reason we can develop skills and knowledge through effort, practice and persistence.
            Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with certain skills,
            their abilities aren't set in stone. They think that with work, their skills can improve over time.
        </p>
        <p> 
            So why is it relevant to us?
            Having a growth mindset is important because it can help you overcome obstacles you may face when learning something new and developing a new skill.
            Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination. By changing the way you think, you can change the way you learn.

            I knew about this "growth mindset" concept and I try to practice it in everyday of my life even I tell this to my children so they also can have this mindset that very useful for them.
            Sometimes when I'm struggle with my problem on my learning journey, I always use this mindset and help me a lot
