            <h1 class="header"> My Learning Plan </h1>
        </div>
            <p>My long term goal is I can find a career that I love. I have done several job and carrer in the past and I was preety good at it but I was not enjoy it.
               I want to do a career that I can enjoy and not only just a "work" but also it can be like a hobby</p>
            <p>My strength when it comes to learning is I am a fast learner and eager to learning something new 
               but I have a limitations which is I don't have a confidence that I do the right one when learning a new things </p>
            <p>I would like to develop my confidence while at Dev Academy, I have to believe there are a lot of potential in me</p>         
            <p>I manage my time every day between family,friend and study. Usually I study in the morning until afternoon when my daughters at school, evening time is family time 
               but sometimes if I have to finish something I do study at night time when my children fall asleep already
               I manage to start have a conversation with my team work and facilitator if I have some issue with my project via discord
               and when things are building up and starting to get to me, I will priorities to finish the important things </p>
            <p>The first thing I will do if I seek a help is googling the problem then if I'm still stuck, I will ask a question to other learner or facilitator via discord.</p>
            <p>I expect I can get a good feedback from the facilitation team so I can improve my skill</p>
            <p>My block-out times is from 6pm, that is start when I have to prepare dinner, having a dinner and spend quality time with my family</p>
