            <h1 class="header"> My Learning Plan </h1>
        </div>
            <p>My long term goal is I can find a career that I love. I have done several job and carrer in the past and I was preety good at it but I was not enjoy it.
               I want to do a career that I can enjoy and not only just a "work" but also it can be like a hobby</p>
            <p>My strength when it comes to learning is I am a fast learner and eager to learning something new 
               but I have a limitations which is I don't have a confidence that I do the right one when learning a new things </p>
            <p>I would like to develop my confidence while at Dev Academy, I have to believe there are a lot of potential in me</p>         
            <p>I manage my time every day between family,friend and study. Usually I study in the morning until afternoon when my daughters at school, evening time is family time 
               but sometimes if I have to finish something I do study at night time when my children fall asleep already
               I manage to start have a conversation with my team work and facilitator if I have some issue with my project via discord
               and when things are building up and starting to get to me, I will priorities to finish the important things </p>
            <p>The first thing I will do if I seek a help is googling the problem then if I'm still stuck, I will ask a question to other learner or facilitator via discord.</p>
            <p>I expect I can get a good feedback from the facilitation team so I can improve my skill</p>
            <p>My block-out times is from 6pm, that is start when I have to prepare dinner, having a dinner and spend quality time with my family</p>
            <p>
                I'm hoping I can use the skill that I gain during this course for work and for my hobby too.
                My hobby is cooking so I'm planning to build my own cooking blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't discovered any new strength or limitation from previous one but I'm still trying to build on my confidence.
                My biggest non technical challenge at Bootcamp will be speaking in front of the group. 
                In the bootcamp I would like to work on communication with other people.
                I hope in the bootcamp I can learn more about JavaScript with more practices from the projects.
                I will manage myself to work productively, if I get stuck for half an hour, I'll ask for help
