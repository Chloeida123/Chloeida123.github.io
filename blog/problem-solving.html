            <h1 class="header"> PROBLEM SOLVING </h1>
        </div>
            <p> 
                When you're just starting out with programming, it's easy to run into problems that make you wonder
                how anyone has ever managed to write a computer program. But the fact is, 
                just about everyone else who's learned to code has had that experience and wondered the same thing, 
                when they were starting out. This experience also happen to me most of the time, it could be only a simple problem or could be the hard one
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the simple problem that I had was when I want to insert an image to my blog page and it didn't work.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Insert Image 1.jpg">
            <p>
                At first, I try to change it with other images because I thought the images that I insert might be get blocked by the owner but still didn't work
                Second move, I asked to one of my study group, he advise me to make another directory for images and insert the images from there. I tried it and still didn't work
            </p>
            <img src="../images/directory.jpg">
            <img src="../images/Insert Image 2.jpg">
            <p>
                Finally I take a look the other blog page that I made before, I just realized that I type the wrong code. It should be “img src” not “img scr”
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Insert Image 3.jpg"> 
            <p>
                It's only because small simple thing ,cost an hour my study times
            </p>

            <p>
                I learn that I need to be more carefully type the code, sometimes it can only because using the space, colon, etc or even only because I forget to save it can cause a problem
            </p>
            <p> 
                I do experience other problem which I can solve it elegantly. The task requirement to display a Fizz Buzz in particular number but in array. 
                First thing I read pseudocode that already provided and I try to write the code and when I got stuck, I'm searching on google how to solve it and done and it's pretty good feeling.
                The thing that I learn from this experience is I still can do it as long as I still want to try it (Don't give up easily)
            </p>

                There are some ways to solve the problem in programming (problem-solving techniques/processes):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                     Pseudocode : I'm pretty a lot using this techniques since I learned Python, the tutor always asked me to make the algorithm or flow chart before I start to write the code 
                     so we can fully understand what is the question/requirement
                </li>
                <li> 
                     Trying something : I also using this techniques to start write the code after I made the algorithm/flowchart
                </li>
                <li> 
                     Rubber ducky method : I never heard of it before and will try use this techniques in the future
                </li>
                <li> 
                     Reading error message : Sometimes it can be helpfull but sometimes not so I'm not 100% sure about this techniques
                </li>
                <li> 
                     Console.logging : I think this is the best way to see what is the result of the code that we write
                </li>
                <li> 
                     Googling : This techniques is the most techniques that I always use for problem solving
                </li>
                <li> 
                     Asking your peers for help : This is the last techniques I use if I still don't get the answer after do all the thing that I mention above
                </li>
                <li> 
                     Asking coaches for help : Before I join DEA, I prefer to ask coaches or tutor for help rather than my friend/peers because I tought they have more experience,
                     but since my facilitator told me that this is the part of learning, now I start to ask them first before I ask the coaches and I pretty confidence at it now.
                </li>
                <li>
                     Improving your process with reflection : I'm confidence with this techniques because I can reflect what all the things that I've done on that week and review it.
                     Which one I was good at it and which one I still have to do more practices.
                </li>
            </ul>
