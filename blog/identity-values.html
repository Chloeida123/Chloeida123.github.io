            <h1 class="header"> My Identity Values </h1>
        </div>
            <p> I work at Supermarket as a checkout supervisor, I have an access to override the price, one time there is a customer asked me to override price of her grocery that she bought
                She told me that she has so many children to feed and she didn't have enough money. I was having an ethical conflict at that time, I decided not to override the price, I'd break the company policy if I did
                but instead I paid for her grocery from my pocket, one of value thing in my life is helping people in need. I don't regret my decision and it's feel that's the right thing to do</p>
            <p> My Asian culture has a lot influenced to my value and my identity, my mom always teach me a work hard to achieve our dream,never give up and have an ambition/goal or people usually call a dream in your life also don't forget to help and care other people too</p>
            <p> My strength are fast learner, eager to learn something new, and always do my best. I was working at sushi shop when I just arrived in New Zealand, at that time my English wasn't really good and I don't have any experience working in the restaurant
                I don't even know how to cut vegetable properly, I learn a lot and in 3 months my manager asked me to become his assistant and become the manager of that shop the next year.
                My limitation is always with my confidence, as I mention before that I always do my best and want to be perfect, me and my brain always said that I'm not good enough to do it.
                I realise with this kind of mindset make a limitation to myself. Luckily I'm surrounded by people who always remind me that I still have a lot of potential, don't limit yourself with that kind of mindset</p>         
            <p> The good thing is I always have a passion to learn something new so if sometime I get stuck with my learning, I won't give up. I don't hesitate to ask someone that know better or just simply googling it </p>
            <p> It was on August last year when suddenly all New Zealand went into lockdown and I have a group assignment that has to be finished another 2weeks. They didn't show up on the zoom meeting that the tutor already arrange for us
                and feels like I was left alone to do all the group assignment by myself. I start emailed them and asked nicely why they didn't show up on the meeting and I devide into parts and asked them which part do you want to deal with.
                It was a good strategy though because it seems like they lost because of lockdown suddenly happen and they didn't what next they have to do. They just need to focus on part they choose, they start working on it, finished it and emailed back to me.
                I think I'm gonna still do the same thing if I had the same situation in the future or in my next project on the bootcamp when we pairing with someone to finish the project that given to us.
                The key to work productively is good communication.</p>
            <p> Let me finish with quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
