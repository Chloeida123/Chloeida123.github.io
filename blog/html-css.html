      </div>
      <p>If you're new to CSS,you might have heard the words margin, border and padding but aren't quite sure what thet mean,
        or how to use them in your website designs. These concepts do similar things in CSS. However, they're not quite the same,
        and there are important fundamental differences in their usage.</p>
      <p>Once you fully understand the difference between margin, border and padding, you'll be able to make better design decisions for your website.</p>
      <p>So let's take a look at these three properties and what they do</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Margin is the space around an element's border, uses for change an element's position on the page </li>
        <li>A Border goes around the padding and content, uses for set a visible border width for a table</li>
        <li>A Padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content, uses for add space between content and its border</li>
      </ul>
