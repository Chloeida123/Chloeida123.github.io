            <h1 class="header"> HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript </h1>
        </div>
        <p> If you have ever visited a walkable city like HongKong, then you can understand the way that HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together
            Let's imagine that you are in charge of planning the layout of a new neighborhood in the city
            This neighborhood will have some residential buildings, some eateries, a bank and a mall</p>
        <p> An HTML file contains the structure od the page itself. It is kind of like the structure of the building
            A CSS file contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning and more. It is kind of like the design of the building itself
            A JavaScript file determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elemetns. This is kind of like the functionality of the building.</p>
        <p> Let's take the example of one of the houses. A house has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. This is the HTML of the building
            It is made of brick and has a solid wood door. That corresponds to the CSS of the building
            What can you do within the house? You can eat, sleep, make meals and anything that you do at home. That is the JavaScript of the building.</p>
        <p> Our HTML file actually has three seperate sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The head, where you can include metadata and links to services like Google Fonts </li>
            <li>The body, where you include metadata and links to services like Google Fonts </li>
            <li>The script tags, which can link to Google Analytics and JavaScript files</li>
        </ul>
        <img scr="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/padding.jpg" class="center">
        <p> The link tag will allow you to create a separate stylesheet to use with all brick houses at sytle.css
            and the script tag allows you to create a set of functions that would apply to any type of home in the script.js.file </p>
