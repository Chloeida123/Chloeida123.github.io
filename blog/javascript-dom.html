            <h1 class="header"> HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript </h1>
        </div>
        <p> If you have ever visited a walkable city like HongKong, then you can understand the way that HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together.
            Let's imagine that you are in charge of planning the layout of a new neighborhood in the city.
            This neighborhood will have some residential buildings, some eateries, a bank and a mall</p>
        <p> An HTML file contains the structure od the page itself. It is kind of like the structure of the building
            A CSS file contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning and more. It is kind of like the design of the building itself
            A JavaScript file determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elemetns. This is kind of like the functionality of the building.</p>
        <p> Let's take the example of one of the houses. A house has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. This is the HTML of the building
            It is made of brick and has a solid wood door. That corresponds to the CSS of the building
            What can you do within the house? You can eat, sleep, make meals and anything that you do at home. That is the JavaScript of the building.</p>
        <img src="../images/house.jpg">    
        <p> Our HTML file actually has three seperate sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The head, where you can include metadata and links to services like Google Fonts </li>
            <li>The body, where you include metadata and links to services like Google Fonts </li>
            <li>The script tags, which can link to Google Analytics and JavaScript files</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="../images/HTML.png">
        <p> The link tag will allow you to create a separate stylesheet to use with all brick houses at sytle.css
            and the script tag allows you to create a set of functions that would apply to any type of home in the script.js.file </p>
        <p> In computer programming, control flow is the order function calls, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluated when a program is running.
            An example of a control flow statement is an if/else statement.
            There is also a loop statement. A real life example of a loop could be your music playlist. While you have a song that's available to be played, it will keep going through your song list 
            and stop when there is no more music that can be listened to. </p>   
        <p> DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming for documents. The object model itself closely resembles the structure of the document it models.
            DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document.
            With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, attributes, or elements of HTML using commands and methods provide by the document object</p>
            <img src="../images/DOM.png">
        <p> Object are used to represent a "thing" in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game
            basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value
            Properties in objects can be accessed by using either dot or bracket notation</p>
        <p> Array are used whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable.
            Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.
            Arrays use zero based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on.</p>
            <img src="../images/Array.png">
        <p> Functions are a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Function is executed when we calls it.
            Function may have a parameters and listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
            Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
            Function is really helpful because we can reuse the code whenever we need it, we don't need to write the code all over again.
            We can use the same come many times with different arguments and produce different result.</p>
