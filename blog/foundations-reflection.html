        </div>
        <p> 
            Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> I'm not a good listener and I'm trying to be a good listener</li>
            <li> I'm lack of mindfulness and I'm trying to practice mindfulness everyday</li>
            <li> Brain is like a plastic and it can grow, it's mean I can learn anyhing as long as I have a willing to learn </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The most part that I was suprised about the core leaning is the mindfulness part because I never heard about it before
            and I always have a struggle with it in my life. The most challenging aspects of the core learning is how to do the listening and looping
            especially with someone you don't know or you just know and they talk about the thing that I'm not really interest with.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I think that is a good thing to spend some time focusing on core learning in web development bootcamp course,
            make the difference with other programming school. I like studying core learning and I think it's not a waste of times
            I remember when I had an job interview, the interviewer said the one they're looking for is not the person who has a good 
            knowledge but the person who has a good attitudes because the person who has a good/ right attitudes, easy for them to learn anything
